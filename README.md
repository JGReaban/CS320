Repository for my work in the CS320 - Software Testing Automation and QA at SNHU
Q. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

A. Firstly, try to write it to be secure and functional, meeting all the requirements and using the
best industry standards. Secondly, when that is done, to use several types of testing (as described in
the CS-320 Project Two Document) to ensure that it is actually secure and works

Q. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

A. Soliciting the requirements for a program is a fairly involved process (or so I learned in past classes)
and involves dealing with customer representatives and drawing all shorts of charts. But beyond that, I need to 
make sure their needs can be incorporates legally and securely. Then write the program and have them send it to 
accemptance testing by people who are the ones that will use the program, to make sure it does meet their needs.

Q. How do I approach designing software?

A. Using the knowledges I've gained so far here at SNHU, using the industry's best practices, and comprehensively
testing my programs
